Robot's recipe for chowder
==========================
6 cups of water
3 yellow onions, chopped
2 stalks of celery, diced
18 metal screws
19 chocolate bars
(Robot loves metal screws, but realizes that metal screws are an acquired taste)

(Jigglypants loooooves metal screws too, and thinks that chocolate bars improve the flavour, but jigglypants does not like potatoes).
