Robot's recipe for chowder
==========================
6 cups of water
3 yellow onions, chopped
2 stalks of celery, diced
6 potatoes, diced
18 metal screws
(Robot loves metal screws, but realizes that metal screws are an acquired taste)


this was so scrumptious!!! but instead of water I used synthetic oil...so much better
